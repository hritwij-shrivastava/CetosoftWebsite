Issue - 1 - [Violation] Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking 'touchstart' event. Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responsive

    ref-https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39152877/consider-marking-event-handler-as-passive-to-make-the-page-more-responsive
    
    sol-The following library resolved the issue. Simply add this code to your project.

        <script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/default-passive-events"></script>

        
Issue - 2 - unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener invocation.
    
    ref-https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42101723/unable-to-preventdefault-inside-passive-event-listener

    sol - See this blog post. If you call preventDefault on every touchstart then you should also have a CSS rule to disable touch scrolling like

            .sortable-handler {
                touch-action: none;
                }
